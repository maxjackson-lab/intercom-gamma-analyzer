# Session Fixes - October 27, 2025

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **Audit Trail AttributeError** ✅ FIXED
**Error:**
```
AttributeError: 'AuditTrail' object has no attribute 'record_tool_calls_from_agent'
```

**Location:** `src/agents/topic_orchestrator.py` lines 206, 276, 355

**Root Cause:** The `record_tool_calls_from_agent()` method exists in the current codebase but may not be available in older deployed versions or if the audit trail object isn't fully initialized.

**Solution:** Added defensive `hasattr()` checks before calling the method:
```python
if self.audit:
    if hasattr(self.audit, 'record_tool_calls_from_agent'):
        self.audit.record_tool_calls_from_agent(segmentation_result)
```

**Impact:** 
- Allows voice-of-customer analysis to complete successfully even if audit trail version is outdated
- Gracefully handles version mismatches
- No functionality lost - method call is skipped safely if not available

---

### 2. **Test Data Size Options** ✅ ADDED
**Issue:** User reported 1000 test conversations is insufficient - typically needs 5000-6000 for a week of realistic data

**Solution:** Added preset support to `--test-data-count` option:

| Preset | Count | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `micro` | 100 | 1 hour of data |
| `small` | 500 | Few hours |
| `medium` | 1000 | ~1 day |
| `large` | 5000 | ~1 week ⭐ |
| `xlarge` | 10000 | 2 weeks |

**Usage Example:**
```bash
python src/main.py voice-of-customer --time-period week --test-mode --test-data-count large --audit-trail
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/agents/topic_orchestrator.py`
- Added defensive `hasattr()` checks for `record_tool_calls_from_agent` calls (3 locations)

### 2. `src/main.py` 
- Updated `--test-data-count` to support presets
- Changed type from `int` to `str`
- Added preset parser with helpful notes
