# Railway GitHub Connection Troubleshooting

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue: Railway Can't Find Your Repository**

**Symptoms:**
- Repository doesn't appear in search
- "Repository not found" error
- Connection fails during setup

**Solutions:**

#### **1. Check Repository Visibility**
```bash
# Verify your repository exists and is accessible
curl -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/maxjackson-lab/intercom-gamma-analyzer
```

#### **2. Re-authorize Railway in GitHub**
1. Go to [GitHub Settings â†’ Applications â†’ Authorized OAuth Apps](https://github.com/settings/applications)
2. Find "Railway" in the list
3. Click "Revoke access"
4. Go back to Railway and reconnect GitHub
5. Grant all necessary permissions

#### **3. Check GitHub Organization Permissions**
- If `maxjackson-lab` is an organization, make sure Railway has access
- Go to Organization Settings â†’ Third-party access
- Ensure Railway is authorized

#### **4. Try Different Repository Name Formats**
- `maxjackson-lab/intercom-gamma-analyzer`
- `intercom-gamma-analyzer`
- `maxjackson-lab/intercom-gamma-analyzer.git`

### **Issue: Permission Denied**

**Solutions:**

#### **1. Check Repository Access**
- Make sure your GitHub account has access to the repository
- If it's an organization repo, ensure you're a member

#### **2. Verify Railway Permissions**
- Railway needs: `repo`, `read:org`, `user:email` permissions
- Re-authorize if permissions are insufficient

### **Issue: Repository Shows as Private**

**Solutions:**

#### **1. Make Repository Public (Temporary)**
```bash
# Go to repository settings on GitHub
# Change visibility to "Public"
# Deploy on Railway
# Change back to "Private" if needed
```

#### **2. Grant Railway Access to Private Repos**
- In Railway settings, ensure "Private repositories" is enabled
- Re-authorize GitHub connection
