## Recommendations

### **Phase 2B: Enhanced Multilingual Keywords**

**Should we implement these enhancements?**

**YES - for these categories:**
1. ✅ **Billing** - Add Italian + German keywords (19 + 17 convs = good sample)
2. ✅ **Product Question** - Add German keywords (22 convs)
3. ✅ **Billing** - Enhance Spanish/Portuguese with NEW keywords from combined data

**Impact:**
- Current: 93.2% keyword match (with Phase 1 + Phase 2)
- With enhancements: **94-95% keyword match** (marginal but more robust)

**Benefits:**
- Time-proven: Keywords appear in BOTH Oct and Nov
- Language coverage: Italian + German speakers (6% of users)
- Seasonal stability: Works across different time periods

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT** - The combined data gives us more confidence!
