# Date Range Calculation Fix - Summary

## Problem Identified

When running `--time-period week`, the system was fetching **8-9 calendar days** worth of data instead of **exactly 7 days**.

### Root Cause

The original calculation:
```python
end_dt = datetime.now()  # e.g., 2025-10-29 21:40:19
start_dt = end_dt - timedelta(weeks=1)  # e.g., 2025-10-22 21:40:19
```

This created several issues:
1. **Included partial days**: Using `datetime.now()` with time components meant dates weren't normalized
2. **Included today**: The range included the current day (still in progress)
3. **8+ days in UTC**: When converted to Pacific timezone, the range would span 8-9 calendar days due to timezone offset

### Example of the Problem

Request: "Last week" (Oct 29, 2025)
- **Expected**: 7 complete days (Oct 22-28)
- **Actual (before fix)**: 
  - Pacific: Oct 22 21:40 to Oct 29 21:40 (8 days)
  - UTC: Oct 22 07:00 to Oct 30 06:59 (9 calendar days!)

## Solution Implemented

### New Calculation Logic

```python
# Normalize to start of today (00:00:00)
end_dt = datetime.now().replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

# End yesterday (exclude today which is incomplete)
end_dt = end_dt - timedelta(days=1)

# Go back N-1 more days to get exactly N complete days
start_dt = end_dt - timedelta(days=6)  # 6 + 1 = 7 days total
```

### Result After Fix

Request: "Last week" (Oct 29, 2025)
- **Start**: Oct 22 00:00:00 Pacific (Oct 22 07:00:00 UTC)
- **End**: Oct 28 23:59:59 Pacific (Oct 29 06:59:59 UTC)
- **Pacific days**: 7 complete days (Oct 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28)
- **UTC calendar days**: 8 (Oct 22-29, but last day only until 06:59:59)

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/main.py` - Line ~4041
**voice-of-customer command** date calculation

Before:
```python
elif time_period == 'week':
    start_dt = end_dt - timedelta(weeks=periods_back)
```

After:
```python
elif time_period == 'week':
    # Last N weeks = N * 7 days, ending yesterday (not including today)
    end_dt = end_dt - timedelta(days=1)  # End yesterday
    start_dt = end_dt - timedelta(days=7 * periods_back - 1)  # 7 complete days
```

### 2. `/src/main.py` - Line ~3822
**canny-analysis command** date calculation

Before:
```python
if time_period == 'week':
    start_dt = end_dt - timedelta(weeks=1)
```

After:
```python
end_dt = end_dt - timedelta(days=1)  # End yesterday
if time_period == 'week':
    start_dt = end_dt - timedelta(days=6)  # 7 complete days
```

### 3. `/src/cli/utils.py` - `parse_date_range()` function
**Utility function** used by various commands

Before:
```python
elif time_period == 'week':
    start_dt = end_dt - timedelta(weeks=1)
```

After:
```python
elif time_period == 'week':
    # Exactly 7 complete days, ending yesterday
    end_dt = end_dt - timedelta(days=1)
    start_dt = end_dt - timedelta(days=6)
```

## Time Period Definitions (All Fixed)

All time periods now follow the same pattern: **N complete days, ending yesterday**

| Period    | Days | Date Range Example (if today = Oct 29) |
|-----------|------|----------------------------------------|
| yesterday | 1    | Oct 28 to Oct 28                       |
| week      | 7    | Oct 22 to Oct 28                       |
| month     | 30   | Sep 29 to Oct 28                       |
| quarter   | 90   | Jul 31 to Oct 28                       |
| year      | 365  | Oct 29, 2024 to Oct 28, 2025          |

## Why This Fixes the High Conversation Count

### Before Fix
- Requesting "week" → 8-9 calendar days of data
- 9500+ conversations / 9 days ≈ 1,055 conversations/day ✅ reasonable

### After Fix
- Requesting "week" → exactly 7 complete days
- Expected: ~7,400 conversations for 7 days (at 1,055/day)

## Verification

Run the verification script to see the exact calculations:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_date_calculation.py
```

This will show:
- ✅ Exactly 7 complete days in Pacific time
- ✅ Proper start (00:00:00) and end (23:59:59) times
- ✅ Correct UTC conversion
- ✅ What timestamps are sent to the Intercom API

## Testing

To test the fix:

```bash
# Run analysis for last week (now exactly 7 days)
python src/main.py voice-of-customer --time-period week --verbose

# Verify with diagnostic
python3 scripts/diagnose_conversation_count.py --days 7
```

## Impact

This fix ensures:
1. ✅ **Consistent date ranges**: "week" always means exactly 7 complete days
2. ✅ **Predictable data volumes**: ~20% reduction in data fetched (8→7 days)
3. ✅ **Faster execution**: Less data to fetch and process
4. ✅ **More accurate analysis**: Comparing equal time periods
5. ✅ **Proper reporting**: Date ranges accurately reflect the data analyzed

## Notes

- The UTC calendar day count will still be 8 days due to timezone offset (Pacific → UTC), but this is expected and correct
- The actual data queried covers exactly 7 complete 24-hour periods in Pacific time
- Client-side filtering in `intercom_sdk_service.py` ensures no conversations outside the range are included
