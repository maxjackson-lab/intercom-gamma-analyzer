# Phase 3: Troubleshooting Analysis - IMPLEMENTED ‚úÖ

**Implementation Date**: October 25, 2025  
**Version**: 3.0.7-troubleshooting

## üéØ **What Was Implemented**

AI-powered analysis of agent troubleshooting behavior - your **main focus** for Horatio coaching!

> **User's Priority**: "what troubleshooting they are doing is it consistent... If they escalate without asking technical troubleshooting, how much they troubleshoot - that's kind of my big focus for them honestly"

---

## üîç **Features**

### **1. Troubleshooting Effort Analysis**
For each problematic conversation, AI analyzes:
- How many diagnostic questions were asked (0-10)
- Whether agent asked for error messages/screenshots
- Whether agent tried multiple solutions
- Whether agent showed empathy and effort

### **2. Premature Escalation Detection**
Automatically flags conversations where agent:
- Escalated with <2 diagnostic questions
- Didn't try any troubleshooting steps
- Immediately said "I'll escalate" without attempting resolution

### **3. Consistency Tracking**
Measures variance in troubleshooting approach:
- Does agent always follow same process?
- Or do they sometimes try hard, sometimes give up?
- Inconsistency = coaching opportunity

### **4. Controllable vs Uncontrollable Classification**
AI determines if issue was:
- **Controllable**: Agent's fault (poor troubleshooting, bad tone, wrong info)
- **Uncontrollable**: Product bug, policy limitation, legitimate escalation need

---

## ü§ñ **How It Works**

### **AI Analysis Per Conversation**

**Input:** Conversation full text  
**Output:** JSON analysis

```json
{
  "diagnostic_questions_count": 1,
  "showed_effort": false,
  "asked_for_details": false,
  "tried_alternatives": false,
  "showed_empathy": false,
  "troubleshooting_score": 0.2,
  "premature_escalation": true,
  "controllable": true,
  "issue_type": "premature_escalation",
  "reasoning": "Agent escalated immediately without asking for error messages, screenshots, or browser details. No troubleshooting attempted."
}
```

### **Aggregate Agent Pattern**

Analyzes 10 priority conversations per agent (escalated/low-CSAT):

```json
{
  "agent_name": "Lorna",
  "conversations_analyzed": 10,
  "avg_troubleshooting_score": 0.35,
  "avg_diagnostic_questions": 1.2,
  "premature_escalation_rate": 0.70,
  "adequate_troubleshooting_rate": 0.20,
  "consistency_score": 0.45,
  "issues_identified": [
    "High premature escalation rate",
    "Insufficient diagnostic questions",
    "Low overall troubleshooting effort",
    "Inconsistent troubleshooting approach"
  ]
}
```

## üìä **New Metrics Per Agent**

| Metric | Description | Good | Bad |
|--------|-------------|------|-----|
| **Troubleshooting Score** | Overall effort (0-1) | >0.7 | <0.4 |
| **Diagnostic Questions** | Avg questions asked | >3 | <2 |
| **Premature Escalation Rate** | % escalated without trying | <20% | >40% |
| **Consistency Score** | Process consistency (0-1) | >0.7 | <0.6 |

## üìã **Example Coaching Report**

```
üéØ COACHING PRIORITY: HIGH - Lorna

üìã Coaching Focus Areas:
1. CRITICAL: Premature Escalations (70%) - Establish troubleshooting checklist before escalating ‚ö†Ô∏è
2. Insufficient Diagnostic Questions (avg 1.2) - Require minimum 3 questions before escalating ‚ö†Ô∏è
3. Inconsistent Troubleshooting Approach - Apply process consistently ‚ö†Ô∏è
4. URGENT: Low CSAT (3.07) - Review worst tickets immediately

üìä Troubleshooting Metrics:
   Troubleshooting Score: 0.35 / 1.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è (Team avg: 0.68)
   Diagnostic Questions: 1.2 avg ‚ö†Ô∏è (Team avg: 3.4)
   Premature Escalations: 70% ‚ö†Ô∏è (Team avg: 22%)
   Consistency: 0.45 / 1.0 ‚ö†Ô∏è (inconsistent approach)

üí¨ Example Premature Escalations:
   Conversation #456789:
   - Escalated after 1 question
   - Didn't ask for error message or screenshot
   - No alternative solutions offered
   - Issue: Bug>Export
   - Reasoning: "Agent escalated immediately without asking for error details"

   Conversation #456790:
   - Escalated with 0 diagnostic questions
   - Immediately said "I'll escalate this to our technical team"
   - Customer: "My presentation won't export"
   - Agent never asked: What browser? What error? Can you screenshot it?

üéØ COACHING ACTIONS:
1. Review premature escalation examples with Lorna
2. Establish mandatory troubleshooting checklist:
   ‚úì Ask what error message appeared
   ‚úì Ask for screenshot
   ‚úì Ask what browser/device
   ‚úì Try at least 2 solutions before escalating
3. Role-play proper diagnostic approach
4. Track improvement week-over-week
```

## üîß **Implementation Details**

### **New File: `src/services/troubleshooting_analyzer.py`**

**Key Methods:**
- `analyze_conversation_troubleshooting()` - Analyzes single conversation
- `analyze_agent_troubleshooting_pattern()` - Aggregates across agent's conversations
- `_build_analysis_prompt()` - Constructs AI prompt with rubric

**AI Prompt Rubric:**
```
1. Count diagnostic questions (what error? screenshot? browser? when started?)
2. Evaluate effort (tried multiple solutions? offered alternatives?)
3. Check for detail requests (error messages, screenshots, logs)
4. Assess empathy (acknowledged frustration? personalized?)
5. Classify controllable vs uncontrollable
6. Flag premature escalations (escalated with <2 questions)
```

### **Updated: `src/models/agent_performance_models.py`**

**New Fields (Lines 78-100):**
```python
# Troubleshooting metrics
avg_troubleshooting_score: float  # 0-1
avg_diagnostic_questions: float  # 0-10
premature_escalation_rate: float  # 0-1
troubleshooting_consistency: float  # 0-1
```

### **Updated: `src/services/individual_agent_analyzer.py`**

**Integration (Lines 220-239):**
```python
# Troubleshooting analysis (if enabled)
if self.troubleshooting_analyzer:
    troubleshooting_pattern = await self.troubleshooting_analyzer.analyze_agent_troubleshooting_pattern(
        convs,
        agent_info.get('name')
    )
    troubleshooting_metrics = {
        'avg_troubleshooting_score': troubleshooting_pattern['avg_troubleshooting_score'],
        'avg_diagnostic_questions': troubleshooting_pattern['avg_diagnostic_questions'],
        'premature_escalation_rate': troubleshooting_pattern['premature_escalation_rate'],
        'troubleshooting_consistency': troubleshooting_pattern['consistency_score']
    }
```

**Coaching Priority Enhanced (Lines 514-519):**
```python
# HIGH PRIORITY: Poor troubleshooting methodology
if agent.premature_escalation_rate > 0.4:  # >40% premature escalations
    return "high"

if agent.avg_troubleshooting_score < 0.4:  # Low effort score
    return "high"
```

**Coaching Areas Enhanced (Lines 540-556):**
```python
# HIGHEST PRIORITY: Troubleshooting methodology (your main focus!)
if agent.premature_escalation_rate > 0.4:
    areas.append(
        "CRITICAL: Premature Escalations (70%) - "
        "Establish troubleshooting checklist before escalating"
    )

if agent.avg_diagnostic_questions < 2.0:
    areas.append(
        "Insufficient Diagnostic Questions (avg 1.2) - "
        "Require minimum 3 questions before escalating"
    )
```

## üß™ **Usage**

### **Enable Troubleshooting Analysis (Optional)**

```bash
# Standard analysis (fast, no AI troubleshooting analysis)
python src/main.py agent-performance --agent horatio --individual-breakdown --time-period week

# WITH troubleshooting analysis (slower, includes AI analysis)
python src/main.py agent-performance --agent horatio --individual-breakdown --time-period week --analyze-troubleshooting
```

**Performance:**
- **Without:** ~30 seconds for 10 agents
- **With:** ~2 minutes for 10 agents (analyzes 10 conversations per agent with AI)

**Cost:**
- Uses GPT-4o-mini (cheap and fast)
- ~10 conversations √ó 10 agents √ó $0.0001 = $0.01 per analysis
- Worth it for the insights!

## üí° **What You Can Now Track**

### **1. Agent-Specific Patterns**
```
Juan: Always asks 4-5 diagnostic questions ‚úÖ
Lorna: Sometimes asks 3, sometimes asks 0 ‚ö†Ô∏è (inconsistent)
```

### **2. Premature Escalation Trends**
```
Week 1: Lorna 70% premature escalations
Week 2: After coaching ‚Üí 50% premature escalations
Week 3: After checklist ‚Üí 30% premature escalations
‚Üí Improvement visible!
```

### **3. Troubleshooting Checklist Compliance**
```
Required checklist:
‚úì Ask what error appeared
‚úì Ask for screenshot
‚úì Ask what browser
‚úì Try at least 2 solutions

Agent compliance rate: 35% ‚ö†Ô∏è
```

---

## üéØ **Coaching Workflow**

### **Step 1: Identify Agents with Poor Troubleshooting**
Run analysis, filter by:
- Premature escalation rate >40%
- Troubleshooting score <0.4
- Diagnostic questions <2

### **Step 2: Review Specific Examples**
Get conversation links from troubleshooting analysis:
- See exact conversation where agent escalated too quickly
- Review what questions they should have asked
- Identify pattern (always billing? always bugs?)

### **Step 3: Coaching Session**
- Show agent the specific conversations
- Walk through what they should have asked
- Role-play better approach
- Establish mandatory checklist

### **Step 4: Track Improvement**
- Re-run analysis next week
- Compare troubleshooting score week-over-week
- Celebrate improvements, address declines
