## 🧪 **What to Test**

### **High Confidence (Should Work):**
```
✅ VoC: Hilary Format → Last Week → Gamma → Run
✅ Billing Analysis → Last Week → Run
✅ Product Feedback → Last Month → Run
```

### **Medium Confidence (Should Work):**
```
⚠️ Horatio: Individual Agents → Last Week → Run
   (Email extraction may have issues - logs will show)
```

### **New Feature (Ready to Test):**
```
✅ Any analysis → Check "📋 Audit Trail Mode" → Run
   Generates audit_trail report in outputs/
```

---

## 📋 **How to Use Audit Trail**

### **Web UI:**
1. Select any analysis type
2. ✅ Check "📋 Audit Trail Mode (Show Your Work)"
3. Run analysis
4. Look in `outputs/` for `audit_trail_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`

### **What You'll See:**
```markdown
# Analysis Audit Trail

**Total Steps:** 12
**Decisions Made:** 3
**Duration:** 342.5 seconds

## Key Decisions

### Decision #1: How were conversations segmented?
**Answer:** Tier-first classification using custom_attributes
**Reasoning:** Free tier can only use Fin AI
**Data:** Free: 2,103 (39.8%), Paid: 3,183 (60.2%)

## Step-by-Step Process

Step 1 (0.0s): Started VoC Analysis
Step 2 (0.1s): Fetching from Intercom API
Step 3 (36.8s): Fetched 5,286 conversations
Step 4 (39.0s): Segmented into Free/Paid
...
```

**This builds confidence in your "vibecoded" logic!**
