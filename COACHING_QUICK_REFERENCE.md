## ‚ö° Pro Tips

### 1. Focus on Subcategories
Generic "Bug" category too broad. Look at subcategories:
- `Bug>Export` vs `Bug>API` vs `Bug>Performance`
- Targeted coaching is more effective

### 2. Use Example Conversations
Each agent has:
- `best_example_url`: Show what they did well
- `needs_coaching_example_url`: Discuss improvement areas

### 3. Track Trends
Don't just look at current week:
- Week-over-week: Is coaching working?
- Month-over-month: Long-term improvement?

### 4. Compare Peers
If John struggles with Bug>Export but Maria excels:
- Pair them for shadowing
- Have Maria share her approach
- Leverage team strengths

### 5. Celebrate Wins
Use highlights for:
- Team Slack announcements
- Performance bonuses
- Peer recognition
