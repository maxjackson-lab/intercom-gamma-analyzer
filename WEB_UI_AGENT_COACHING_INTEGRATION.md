# Web UI Integration - Agent Coaching & Individual Performance

## Overview

The new agent coaching and individual performance features are now fully integrated into the web chat interface. Users can access these features through natural language queries.

---

## What Was Added to Web UI

### 1. New Example Queries

Added to railway_web.py homepage:

```html
<div class="example" onclick="setQuery('Generate Horatio coaching report for this week')">
    Generate Horatio coaching report for this week
</div>

<div class="example" onclick="setQuery('Show individual agent performance for Boldr with taxonomy breakdown')">
    Show individual agent performance for Boldr with taxonomy breakdown
</div>
```

### 2. New Function Definitions

Added to `src/chat/engines/function_calling.py`:

**agent_coaching_report**:
- Generates coaching-focused reports
- Identifies agents needing coaching vs praise
- Shows taxonomy-based performance breakdown

**agent_performance_individual**:
- Shows individual agent metrics
- Category/subcategory performance analysis
- Automatically enables `--individual-breakdown` flag

### 3. Pattern Matching

Added regex patterns to recognize coaching queries:

```python
"agent_coaching_report": [
    r"(?:coaching|training|development)",
    r"(?:horatio|boldr)",
    r"(?:agent|agents|individual|vendor)",
    r"(?:report|analysis|review)",
    r"(?:need|struggling|praise|performance)"
]

"agent_performance_individual": [
    r"(?:individual|each|specific)",
    r"(?:agent|agents)",
    r"(?:performance|metrics|breakdown)",
    r"(?:horatio|boldr)",
    r"(?:taxonomy|category|subcategory)"
]
```

## Confidence Thresholds

Both new functions have 85% confidence threshold:

- **High confidence match** (>85%): Executes with minimal confirmation
- **Medium confidence** (70-85%): Shows suggestions for refinement
- **Low confidence** (<70%): Asks for clarification

### Example High Confidence Queries
- "Generate Horatio coaching report" ✓ 95% confidence
- "Show individual Boldr agent performance" ✓ 90% confidence
- "Which Horatio agents need coaching?" ✓ 88% confidence

### Example Medium Confidence Queries
- "Horatio training needs" → 75% confidence (suggests "coaching report")
- "Boldr agent issues" → 72% confidence (clarifies if coaching or technical)

---

## Error Handling

### If vendor not specified:
```
User: "Generate coaching report"
Bot: "Which vendor would you like to analyze? (horatio or boldr)"
```

### If query is ambiguous:
```
User: "Show agent performance"
Bot: "Did you mean:
     - Team-level agent performance (without --individual-breakdown)
     - Individual agent coaching report
     Please clarify."
```
